Drupal 8 file field formatter allowing to specify the link target.

It differs in several ways from the [FileField Target module on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/filefield_target):

* this one is for Drupal 8, while the other one only exists for Drupal 7
* this one has a dependency on the [File Entity](https://www.drupal.org/project/file_entity) module
